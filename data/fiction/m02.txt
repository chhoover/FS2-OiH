I'm not sure I'm ready for this. It's only been a few weeks since I watched my friends die. Sure, they gave me some leave, pinned a medal on my chest - the whole nine yards - but I don't feel like a hero. They were the real heroes. They're the ones who died so that I could bring back the latest piece of intelligence on the NTF. When did fleet movement schedules become more important to me than the lives of my friends?

I hear Eller's voice in my head shouting at me to put the mission first, but I can't get his face out of my mind. And the worst part is despite Command's assurance that the intel was worth it, I won't be there to see it. It's this blasted war. I can't see straight anymore. I guess we were so caught up in paranoia that the Shivans might come back that we couldn't see what was coming right in front of us. Terrans fighting Terrans - how could we fall so far? The only solution now is to fight it out, I guess. That's what's keeping me going now. If Command thinks I'm ready for my own wing - if they think I can help end this war, then I'll serve.

But part of me is dead. I'm not ready to make friends again. It's not fair to my wing, but if I'm to have a command of my own, I can't risk it. I don't think I could make the same choice again and be able to live with myself. And the mission must come first, so there don't have to be any more Ellers, or Cramers, or Vituccis...  No one else is going to die for me.
