[$b Jess $b sits $b at $b one $b of $b the $b tables $b along $b the $b wall, $b nursing $b a $b near $b empty $b drink. $b Joseph $b enters $b and $b walks $b to $b her.]
"Jess? Where is everyone?"

"Sim room, Commander. There's a bet being settled. Nick shot his mouth off again and Grizzly challenged him to prove it."

"Don't tell me - Nick made a crack about his age..."

"Of course he did. Grizzly challenged him to the Heron scenario to prove that, I quote, 'I can still wipe the floor with snot nosed rookies like you, Nick.'"

[$b Joseph $b chuckles.]
 "Sounds like Nick may have gotten more than he bargained for here.  Why aren't you watching the sims with everyone else?"

[$b Jess $b holds $b up $b two $b beverage $b chits.]
"Someone's got to keep track of the stakes...."

"You could do that from the sim room. You should go. Have some fun."

"I didn't sign up for 'fun'. 'Fun' will be bringing this war to a quick end."

"You have to let down sometime, Jess."

"Hmh, look who's talking...."

"What?"

[$b Joseph $b pauses, $b a $b pained $b expression $b on $b his $b face.]
"What do you mean?"

"Nothing. It's late. I should turn in."

"No, I want to hear it."

[$b Jess $b grimaces.]
"You're not the best at letting go, Joseph. Trust me -- it shows. So don't make it sound like you're giving advice from experience you don't have."

[$b Joseph $b looks $b down $b and $b closes $b his $b eyes $b briefly.]
"I'm trying, Jess. I owe it to the three of you... and myself."

"You don't owe us, Joseph -- not yet. You're the best thing that's happened to this wing in months."

"You mean me replacing Harrison. He really hurt you, didn't he?"

"You know what it's like to take orders from someone you can't trust?  We were less than 'just pilots' to him. He hated everyone, himself included."

[$b Voices $b rise $b in $b the $b distance. $b Jess $b gets $b up.]
"Sounds like they finished."

[$b Voices $b crescendo $b and $b Nick, $b Quique, $b Grizzly, $b and $b several $b other $b pilots $b enter. $b Nick $b gestures $b wildly $b with $b his $b hands.]
"I'm telling you, there's no way he could have gotten around me so fast!"

[$b Quique $b grins $b and $b lays $b a $b reproving $b hand $b on $b Nick's $b shoulder.]
"Not unless he pulled an Eller's turn...."

"In an Apollo?!"

"Ha ha! I saw it with my own eyes, amigo. The old man's got skills."

[$b Nick $b scowls.]
"Dirty tricks, you mean."

[$b Grizzly $b saunters $b over $b to $b Jess $b and $b extends $b an $b open $b hand.]
"Dirty tricks or not, I believe this is mine.”

[$b He $b palms $b the $b two $b beverage $b cards $b and $b smirks $b at $b Nick.]
"I'm off to get my beauty sleep, Nicky boy. Better luck next time."

[$b Grizzly $b exits $b and $b leaves $b Nick $b with $b his $b arms $b crossed, $b still $b scowling.  $b Jess $b leaves $b without $b saying $b a $b word, $b and $b Joseph $b walks $b to $b join $b the $b rest $b of $b Alpha.]
"No snappy comeback, Nick? Mouth finally let you down?"

"Don't worry. I'll get him back sooner or later...."

[$b Quique $b rolls $b his $b eyes.]
"Right...."

"I still can't believe you bet on Grizzly over me!"

"Look on the bright side, amigo. I won this nifty commemorative pin from flight officer Macey.”

[$b A $b lopsided $b grin $b spreads $b across $b Nick's $b face.]
"She bet on me? That's almost good enough news to forget about losing to that old fart."

"Easy now, champ. You came off looking pretty bad there...."

[$b Joseph $b turns $b to $b leave $b and $b makes $b his $b way $b to $b the $b door.]
"Briefing's at 0630. Don't stay out too late, kids."

[$b Nick $b throws $b an $b arm $b across $b Quique's $b shoulders.]
"Oh, don't worry about us, Commander. Now, Quique, amigo... I say we go give Macey back her pin."

"It's my pin now, Nick."

"Come on man, help a brother out..."

[$b Voices $b fade $b as $b Joseph $b walks $b down $b the $b corridor, $b alone $b with $b his $b own $b thoughts.]
